### PHLISOPHICAL QUESTION
- The average number of days in a year, accounting for leap years, is 365.25. The average number of days in a month, accounting for leap years, is approximately 30.4375. Thats 1/8 or 3 hours, it would involving changing the clock 1 time for each of the 2 main solstice days, instead of the gregorian method of leap years. 
- The average year length in the Gregorian calendar system is designed to be 365.2425 days due to the leap year, the actual figure is 365.25 days, so that means Gregorian is 0.01 percent innaccurate. 
- Every four year 43.2 minutess is lost due to the 14.4 minutes. inaccuracy every year, since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582, it has not undergone any major updates or changes, that would mean we have lost 3.315 days??
