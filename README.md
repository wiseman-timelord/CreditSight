Finanace planner details still to be finalized, prediction and history, ascii line graphs and numbers.

Part 1:
By using day records like for example
  1DayRecords = @(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
	10DayRecords = @(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
	100DayRecords = @(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
	1000DayRecodss = @(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
We are able to have large scale, history and prediction, the later records will be of a lesser quality, but, it would result in a high compitence to, remember and predict, based upon a quality history input.

Part 2:
Line graphs.
