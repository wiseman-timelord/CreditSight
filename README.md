## DESCRIPTION
CreditSight is a PowerShell-based personal finance tracking application designed to provide users with a comprehensive view of their financial status. It focuses on visualizing financial data through graphs and maintaining detailed records of financial changes over time.

### FEATURES
- **Credit Visualization**: Visualizes financial changes using a line graph, where each character on the graph represents a scaled period of financial change, combining both history and prediction, based on daily recording of credit.
- **Intelligent ASCII Graphs**: Utilizes different characters to represent various financial states - Â£ for credit, * for higher credit values, x for debt, and X for significant debt.
- **Volatility Prediction**: Displays prediction uncertainty through the thickness of the band in the prediction graph, indicating the volatility of future financial trends, based on, current and past, high/low.
- **Daily Record Rotation**: Features a rotating record system where `DayRecords_10` updates every 10 days and `DayRecords_100` every 100 days, enabling three tiers of predictive capability and historical record-keeping, totalling, 1110 days or 3 years, of history/prediction.
