# CreditSight-Ps

### STATUS: ALPHA
Work to do...
- Fix graph generation. Wooo... "https://geekeefy.wordpress.com/2017/09/04/plot-graph-in-powershell-console/"
- Improve layout of graphs.
- try put borders on graphs.
- The line "$global:filePath = 'scripts/settings.psd1'" allows one to specify the config file, hence, we could have a menu as first screen, to, create new or select existing, settings file, so as to have profiles (.\profiles\ExampleProfileName.Psd1), ie, personal, trading, business, etc, with differing, history and credit. 
- Improve layout of new profile menu.
- Progress scripts to completion over initial plans, think into these plans along the way.
- have option for toggle, bi-directional or 2 graphs (history, prediction). 

## DESCRIPTION
CreditSight is a PowerShell-based personal finance tracking application designed to provide users with a comprehensive view of their financial status. It focuses on visualizing financial data through graphs and maintaining detailed records of financial changes over time.

### FEATURES
- **Credit Visualization**: Visualizes financial changes using a line graph, where each character on the graph represents a scaled period of financial change, combining both history and prediction, based on daily recording of credit.
- **Intelligent ASCII Graphs**: Utilizes different characters to represent various financial states - Â£ for credit, * for higher credit values, x for debt, and X for significant debt.
- **Volatility Prediction**: Displays prediction uncertainty through the thickness of the band in the prediction graph, indicating the volatility of future financial trends, based on, current and past, high/low.
- **Daily Record Rotation**: Features a rotating record system where `DayRecords_10` updates every 10 days and `DayRecords_100` every 100 days, enabling three tiers of predictive capability and historical record-keeping, totalling, 1110 days or 3 years, of history/prediction.
