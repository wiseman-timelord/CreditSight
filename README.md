Finanace planner details still to be finalized, prediction and history, ascii line graphs and numbers.

### Features
- ** Daily Rotation ** Upon booting and events of next day, the graph will be kept current, the keys will be checked against the system date/time hourly.
- **Line Graphs** Each character on the line graph represents a day's financial change. The graph will be constructed as an array of strings, where each string is a line in the graph.
- **Band Thickness** The thickness of the band in the prediction graph will represent the uncertainty or volatility in the prediction. A wider band indicates greater uncertainty.

### NOTES
* The average number of days in a year, accounting for leap years, is 365.25.
* The average number of days in a month, accounting for leap years, is approximately 30.4375.
* It would make sense to have a 1/8 longer day twice a year during 2 main solstice days, as socially acceptable day to do things that, take time or waste time.
