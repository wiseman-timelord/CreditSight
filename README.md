Thats 1/8 or 3 hours, this would work for changing the clock 1 time for each 2 main solstice days, instead of the system of going, forward and back, by an hour. 
- the average year length in the Gregorian calendar system is designed to be 365.2425 days, the actual figure is again is 365.25 days, so that means Gregorian is 0.01 percent innaccurate, and thats, 14.4 minutes every year and 43.2 minutes every four years, out of syncronisity with the actual time.
